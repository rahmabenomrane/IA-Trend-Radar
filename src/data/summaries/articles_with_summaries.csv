prometheus aiming build physical world prometheus focus integrating artificial intelligence sectors like manufacturing robotics heavy machinery everything industrial works atoms bits prometheus answer china advanced industrial robot integrations smart factories jeff bezos taken role ceo new startup named project prometheus interesting bezos first position management since stepped amazon ceo july 2021 project prometheus describes company focuses physical economy simply put prometheus focus application industries require advanced engineering materials science includes manufacturing activities related production physical goods automobiles electronics heavy machinery aerospace manufacturing entire focus artificial intelligence bits several large language models llms today powering numerous chatbots assistants however prometheus wants focus atoms artificial intelligence used stimulate physics automate factories design physical systems reduce manufacturing times prometheus debuts already overcrowded market several small big players fighting create niche however one prometheus biggest advantages huge funding secured large part comes bezos makes one well funded early stage startups globally comparison periodic labs company aims automate scientific discovery focusing physical much like prometheus raised year course prometheus chunky wallet gives head start rivals china lead physical race although attempted hinder china growth sector strict export controls advanced compatible semiconductor chips fact remains china significantly ahead terms physical applications data international federation robotics shows china third list countries highest robot density country 470 robots per 000 employees 402 robots 2022 even commendable china entered top list 2019 years raced past countries like japan germany hand ranks 10th list density 295 robots high robot density points highly automated productive manufacturing sector relatively fewer defects faster iteration cycles

poach talent leading companies something prometheus also done china already surpassed manufacturing extent known world factory left behind areas like advanced battery manufacturing solar production supply chains robotics deployment left behind critical physical industries play catch already steep uphill climb deploying physical might way get close china easy task instance marques brownlee popular tech reviewer discussed neo futuristic robot available today although company markets smart robot things stand anything smart autonomous works largely human command handful tasks without instructions brownlee noted companies currently selling dream even fully creating product using early stage adopters beta testers gap blueprints final product huge one right china already deploying humanoid robots across frontline industrial applications instance walker ubtech china advanced humanoid robot capable running even replace battery compare neo hour battery life teleoperation needs realize gap wider americans would want believe ubtech plans hit annual capacity 000 walker 2027 industrial use smart factories intelligent logistics automotive manufacturing bezos mission critical role one man fit lead herculean effort jeff bezos portfolio experience something even brightest modern day entrepreneur envies bezos built world largest logistics network advanced warehousing system rocket company blue origin cloud computing behemoth aws robotics powerhouse amazon robotics solid prometheus wants build advanced physical stimulators industrial grade systems engineering automation
